        "This notebook has been modified in order to enable users to specify a video and image in one function call and create a deepfake that gets automatically saved to your Google Drive. Some notes: your video and image have to be in a folder called \"deepfake\" in your Google Drive. The video and image have to be square shape (will be resized automatically). Also, make sure these files: /content/gdrive/My Drive/deepfake/vox-256.yaml (available on my GitHub), and \n",

        "\n",
        "Run all the cells in this Notebook. In the last cell, follow the instructions to make your own calls to the run function. If all arguments are correct, you will see the appropriate deepfake in the deepfake folder in your Drive shortly. To automate this, just run the \"run\" function multiple times in the same cell, and run the whole cell. Then, you can step away and have multiple deepfakes created while you are away. Also, I recommend using GPU runtime since it will speed up this process."
